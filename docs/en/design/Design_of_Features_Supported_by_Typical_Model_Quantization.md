## 2. Requirement Scenario Analysis

### 2.1 Feature Requirement Source and Value Overview

With the wide application of large-language model and multi-modal model in the industry, model inference performance has become a key factor restricting large-scale deployment. Currently, mainstream models in the industry, such as GLM, Qwen, HunyuanVideo, and Flux, are slow in the original precision and occupy a large amount of storage resources. Therefore, the real-time requirements of the production environment cannot be met.

The quantization technology can significantly improve the inference speed and reduce the memory usage by reducing the numerical precision of model weights and activation values (for example, from FP16/BF16 to INT8/INT4). This feature provides quantitative support for typical models in the industry and helps users:

1. **Reduced storage costs: Quantification model size can be reduced by 50% to 75%, reducing storage and transport costs**
2. **Expanded deployment scale: More model instances can be deployed with the same hardware resources, improving service throughput.**
3. **Precision assurance: The quantization configuration and calibration policies are carefully designed to ensure that the quantized model precision meets service requirements.**

Without this feature, users cannot use the msModelSlim tool to quantify the preceding models. Instead, they need to implement the quantification process or use other tools, which increases the cost and maintenance burden and reduces the market competitiveness of the tool.

## 4. Use Case 1 Implementation: GLM-4.7 Model W8A8 Quantification

### 4.1 Design Idea

GLM-4.7 is a large language model developed by AI and uses the Transformer architecture. This use case implements W8A8 quantization of the GLM-4.7 model, that is, both the weight and activation value are quantized to the INT8 precision.

**Design Idea:**

1. **Model adaptation: The GLM-4.7 model loading and parsing logic is added to the model adaptation layer to identify key layers (such as Linear, Embedding, and LayerNorm) in the model structure.**
2. **Quantization strategy: Use the MinMax algorithm to quantize weights, use dynamic quantization to quantize activation values, and use FP16 precision for sensitive layers such as LayerNorm.**
3. **Abnormal value processing: Use the SmoothQuant (m1/m2) algorithm to suppress abnormal activation values and improve the quantization precision.**
4. **Calibration data: Use text datasets such as C4 or WikiText for calibration. The recommended number of calibration samples is 512 to 1024.**
5. **Precision assurance: The hierarchical quantization policy and sensitive layer protection are used to ensure that the precision loss of the model is within 3% after quantization.**

### 4.2 Constraints

**Hardware Constraints:**

 * The Ascend NPU (Atlas 300I/300T/800 series) is required.
 * Minimum 32 GB system memory (for 7B scale models)
 * At least 16 GB video memory

**Software Constraints:**

 * Python 3.7+
 * PyTorch 1.8+
 * The transformers library version must support the GLM-4.7 model (4.30+ recommended).
 * The model must be in the HuggingFace format.

**Data Constraints:**

 * A calibration data set needs to be prepared. (text format, 512 to 1024 samples recommended)
 * The distribution of calibration data must be similar to that of model training data.

**Function Constraints:**

 * Model training is not supported during quantization.
 * Quantized models support only inference and do not support continuous training.

### 4.3 Detailed implementation (module-level or process-level message sequence diagram from user entry)

#### 4.3.1 Quantization Process Sequence Diagram

The quantization process includes five phases: configuration analysis, model loading, calibration data processing, quantization execution and result saving. Each module interacts with each other through a unified interface to ensure the integrity and reliability of the quantization process.

**Main process:**

1. Users submit quantification tasks through command lines or Python APIs.
2. The configuration parsing module parses the YAML configuration and generates a quantization policy.
3. The model mediation loads the GLM-4.7 model and parses the structure.
4. The calibration data processing module loads and preprocesses calibration data.
5. The quantization execution engine performs weight quantization and activation value quantization.
6. The result saving module saves the quantized model weight and configuration.

#### 4.3.2 Module Interaction Description

**Configuration parsing module: parses user configurations and generates quantization policiesConfiguration object model adaptation layer: loads the GLM-4.7 model, parses the model structure, and identifies the layer calibration to be quantizedData processing module: loads text data, performs tokenization, and generates calibration data batch quantization Execution engine: Result saving module for executing core quantification processes, such as weight quantization, activation value quantization, and abnormal value processing: saves the quantification weight and configuration for subsequent inference.**

### 4.4 Interfaces Between Subsystems (Mainly Covering the Definition of Module Interfaces)

#### 4.4.1 Model Adaptation Layer Interfaces

**Added the following APIs:**`GLM47ModelLoader`

 * `load_model(model_path: str, device: str) -> torch.nn.Module`Load the GLM-4.7 model.
 * `analyze_structure(model: torch.nn.Module) -> ModelStructure`\: Analyze the model structure and identify the quantization target layer.

#### 4.4.2 Quantized Execution Engine Interface

**Modify the interface:**`QuantizationEngine`

 * `quantize_glm47_w8a8(model, calib_data, config) -> QuantizedModel`\: GLM-4.7 Model W8A8 Quantification

#### 4.4.3 Configuring the Parsing Interface

**Modify the interface:**`ConfigParser`

 * `parse_glm47_config(config_path: str) -> GLM47QuantConfig`\: Parses the GLM-4.7 quantization configuration.

### 4.5 Subsystem LLD

#### 4.5.1 Detailed Design of the Model Mediation Layer

**GLM-4.7 Model Loader: Using Transformers Library**`AutoModelForCausalLM`Load models from the HuggingFace Hub or local path. Identify the key components of the models, such as the embedding layer, transformer layer, and lm_head layer.

**Model structure analyzer: traverses all layers of the model, identifies the Linear layer (used for weight quantization), identifies the LayerNorm layer (marked as the sensitive layer, and retains the FP16), identifies the location of the activation function (used for activation value quantization), and generates the quantization target layer mapping table.**

#### 4.5.2 Detailed Design of the Quantized Execution Engine

**Weight quantization module: Apply MinMax quantization to the weight matrix at the linear layer, calculate the min/max value of each weight matrix, and use symmetric quantization. The quantization range is \[-128, 127\].**

**Activation value quantization module: uses the SmoothQuant algorithm to suppress abnormal values, collects statistics on activation value distribution on calibration data, calculates the quantization parameters of each activation layer, and applies dynamic quantization (quantification during inference).**

**Sensitive layer protection: The LayerNorm layer maintains the FP16 precision, the Embedding layer can retain the FP16 precision or quantization, and the output layer (lm_head) maintains the FP16 precision.**

#### 4.5.3 Detailed Design of Calibration Data Processing

**Text data loading: supports common text dataset formats such as C4 and WikiText, supports user-defined text files (one sample in each line), and automatically performs tokenization (using the tokenizer corresponding to the model).**

**Data preprocessing: Convert the text to token IDs, generate a fixed-length sequence (based on the max_length model), and generate the sequence in batches (batch_size is configurable).**

### 4.6 DFX Attribute Design

#### 4.6.1 Performance Design

**Quantified performance goals:**

 * Quantification time: 30 to 60 minutes for the 7B model (single NPU card)
 * Quantized model size: reduced by about 50%

**Performance optimization measures:**

 * Supports parallel quantification of multiple cards, accelerating the quantification process of large models.
 * Use asynchronous I/O to load calibration data, reducing wait time
 * Resumable transfer is supported during quantization to avoid repeated calculation.

**Impact on existing performance:**

 * New models do not affect the quantization performance of existing models.
 * The quantization algorithm reuses the existing implementation without extra performance overhead.

#### 4.6.2 Upgrade and Capacity Expansion Design

**Version compatibility:**

 * The quantified model weight format is compatible with the existing inference framework.
 * Compatibility processing during model version upgrade
 * The quantization configuration format is backward compatible.

**Capacity expansion design:**

 * Supports multi-card quantization and linearly expands the quantization speed.
 * Supports model shard quantification and processing of ultra-large models.

#### 4.6.3 Exception Handling Design

**Abnormal Scenarios and Handling:**

1. **If the model fails to be loaded, a detailed error message is returned, prompting the user to check the model path and format, and recording the error model path and error type.**
2. **Insufficient calibration data: Warn the user, but allow the quantification to continue (which may affect the precision), and record the number of calibration data samples.**
3. **Excessive loss of quantization precision: A precision report is provided. It is recommended that the quantization policy be adjusted or a higher precision be used, and the precision comparison before and after quantization is recorded.**
4. **Out of memory: Provide the option of fragment quantization, or recommend a larger memory device to record memory usage and overflow location**
5. **Quantized interrupt: Supports resumable upload, saves intermediate results, and records the interrupt location and completed quantification progress.**

#### 4.6.4 Resource Management Design

**Memory usage:**

 * Model loading: about 14 GB (7B model FP16)
 * Temporary memory for the quantization process: 1.5 times the model size (21 GB)
 * Total: Approximately 35 GB system memory

**Disk I/O:**

 * Model loading: Reads the model weight file (about 14 GB).
 * Calibration Data Load: Read the calibration dataset (depending on the size of the dataset)
 * Save the quantization result: Write the quantization weight (about 7 GB).

**Network I/O: If the model is loaded from the HuggingFace Hub, the network download is required.**

**Processing the resource usage:**

 * Out of memory: Offers the option of fragmentation quantization, or prompts the user to use a larger memory device
 * Insufficient disk space: Check the disk space and notify the user in advance.
 * If the network is abnormal, the offline mode is supported and the local model is used.

#### 4.6.5 Miniaturized Design

**Impact on the installation package size:**

 * Added the GLM-4.7 model adaptation code: about 50 KB.
 * New quantization configuration: about 10 KB
 * The total increase is about 60 KB, and the impact is negligible.

**Runtime Memory Impact:**

 * Memory added to the model adaptation layer: about 10 MB
 * Quantization engine has no extra memory overhead (reuse existing implementation)

**CPU usage: The quantization process is mainly performed on the NPU, and the CPU usage is low (< 10%).**

#### 4.6.6 Testability Design

**Function test: Test the GLM-4.7 model loading function, W8A8 quantification process integrity, quantization model inference function, and quantization configuration parsing function.**

**Performance test: test quantification time (target: 7B model < 60 minutes), inference speed after quantification, and model size after quantification (target: reduced by 50%)**

**Precision test: Accuracy comparison before and after quantification (target: loss < 3%), impact of different calibration data sets, and test boundary scenarios (minimum/maximum calibration data sets)**

**Abnormal test: test model loading failure, test calibration data insufficient, test memory insufficient, and test quantization interrupt and recovery.**

**Compatibility test: Test the compatibility between different transformers versions, PyTorch versions, and NPU hardware.**

##### 4.6.7.2 Sensitive Data Analysis

###### 1. Sensitive data list

*The specific scope of sensitive data depends on the specific application scenario of the system. Designers should analyze and judge the sensitive data based on the risks. Typical sensitive data includes authentication credentials (such as passwords) and keys.*

###### 2. Check sensitive operations

*1) Lifecycle dimension: For sensitive data identified, we need to identify the lifecycle of the data and identify the process of generation, use, transmission, persistence, and destruction to avoid unintentional omissions in the subsequent risk identification process. 2) High-risk handling process Identify whether sensitive data is handled with high risks. Typical high-risk processing includes printing, echoing, storage, hard coding, and insecure algorithms. From the perspective of information processing, these high-risk processes are prone to security vulnerabilities when sensitive data is processed. Therefore, detailed check is required. All identified sensitive data must be checked. The sensitive data check matrix is as follows:*

For example, in a typical web system, the following table lists the check results of sensitive data (administrator accounts and passwords) in the lifecycle.

 * Generated: The administrator logs in to the system for the first time to set the password.
 * Usage: The administrator uses the password for authentication when logging in to the system.
 * Transmission: After the administrator enters the login password on the client, the password is transmitted to the server through the network.
 * Persistence: After the administrator sets a password for the first time, the server persists the password in the backend database.
 * Destroy: After a specified period, the administrator is forced to change the password and delete the old password.

## 6. Reliability and availability design

### 6.1 Redundancy Design

*The system adopts the redundancy design. The mirror backup, configuration parameter backup, and data synchronization between the active/standby redundant systems must be considered.*

*During feature design, you need to provide the list of key configuration parameters for backup, data synchronization time and policies between active/standby redundant systems, key data list, data check mechanism, dirty data processing policy, and backup and restoration policy during active/standby switchover.*

*For mirror backup, such as the snapshot/checkpoint mechanism, the backup period, data check mechanism, dirty data processing policy, and restoration policy must be provided. For features that have obvious impact on system performance, design constraints must be provided.*

### 6.2 Fault Management

*Fault management includes fault detection, fault isolation, fault locating, fault recovery, and correlation design.*

*Feature fault management includes fault detection, alarm/log design, fault recovery, and fault interface design.*

*Common design principles for fault management are as follows:*

1. *Comprehensive and rapid fault detection usually considers the detection scope, backup detection, detection speed, and detection impact.*
2. *To control the impact scope of failure, isolation domains such as multi-plane, multi-granularity, and isolation units are usually considered.*
3. *Fast fault recovery usually takes into account the policies such as automatic recovery, priority recovery, hierarchical reset, uncoupled recovery, and hierarchical protection.*

*Common design modes for fault management include RollBack, Fault Bypass, Circuit Breaker, and Isolation Compartment.*

### 6.3 Overload control design

*The overload control design must consider the traffic detection, detection location, service discard location, response message information when a service is discarded, and invoking, invoking relationship, and interfaces between the overload control mechanism and the unified overload control mechanism.*

*A simple overload control mechanism is usually implemented by limiting the rate. The location, default rate limit, and log alarms must be considered.*

*Common design principles of overload control include dynamic rate limiting, flexible scaling, load balancing before traffic control, early control, priority assurance, and elegant degradation.*

1. *Early control: When the system is overloaded, control service access on the front end of service process processing or the processing module that processes services earlier to avoid unnecessary performance consumption caused by intermediate control.*
2. *Priority guarantee: When the system is overloaded, services with higher priorities are preferentially allocated and processed, thus maximizing social benefits.*
3. *Elegant degrade design: degrades non-core services, bypasses core functions, and degrades experience.*

### 6.4 Upgrade Without Service Interruption

*Services are not interrupted during the upgrade of a feature. The message compatibility, configuration data format compatibility, and interface compatibility of the feature in different software versions, interdependency between the feature and peripheral features, and quick rollback in the case of upgrade failure are considered.*

### 6.5 Design for human-caused errors

*The human-caused errors of the feature mainly take the following aspects into consideration:*

1. *High-risk messages and secondary confirmation must be provided for deletion and destructive modification. The default value of the page focus is Cancel. User-visible interfaces (cli and web pages) must be considered, including command interfaces provided by open-source components.*
2. *Check whether the restart operation affects the running of the customer's VM and provide a clear prompt for the restart operation.*
3. *All high-risk operations must be recorded in audit logs.*
4. *Prevent configuration errors, hardware misoperations, system check before operations, and quick rollback after operations are incorrect.*

*Common design principles for human error include:*

1. *Role constraint: The permission control design is used to prevent the configuration scope of different roles from being restricted, preventing configuration errors caused by unauthorized configuration.*
2. *Configuration verification: The configuration validation mechanism is designed to ensure that necessary verification is performed before the configuration takes effect to prevent incorrect configurations from taking effect.*
3. *Backup and restoration: The configuration data backup and restoration design ensures that the configuration data can be quickly restored to the correct state when a configuration error occurs.*

### 6.6 Fault prediction and prevention design

*This feature should cooperate with the system fault prediction and prevention capability to provide related data collection and statistics interfaces. For example, disk space detection.*

## 7. Design for features and non-functional quality attributes

### 7.1 Testability

*Describe the test direction and specifications of the feature, and describe the aspects that should be tested by the test personnel, and the boundary values, abnormal values, and abnormal scenarios that need to be noted.*

### 7.2 Serviceability

*Provides various maintainable and serviceable measures for features, and provides complete documentation for feature usage, maintenance, and troubleshooting.*

### 7.3 Evolvability

*This document focuses on the evolvability of the feature architecture and functions.*

### 7.4 Openness

*Focus on the openness of external interfaces, including the standardization of the interfaces, for example, compliance with the SQL 2011 standard.*

### 7.5 Compatibility

*Focus on whether the feature affects the forward compatibility of the system, that is, whether the old functions are available after the upgrade and whether the usage behavior is consistent with that of the old version.*

### 7.6 Scalability/Scalability

*This feature effectively meets the requirements of system capacity changes, including scaling of database nodes and database servers.*

### 7.7 Maintainability

*Focus on feature maintainability, such as diagnosis view and log printing.*

### 7.8 Information

*Refer to the following table to evaluate the modification points of various documents involved in the feature evaluation and describe the specific modification points.*
