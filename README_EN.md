## 📖 Overview

The Ascend model compression tool MindStudio ModelSlim (msModelSlim) is a compression tool dedicated to hardware acceleration, leveraging compression technologies natively optimized for Ascend architectures. It integrates a suite of inference optimization technologies (such as quantization and compression) designed to accelerate dense foundation models, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, multimodal understanding models, and multimodal generative models.

Ascend AI model developers can call Python APIs to adapt algorithms and models, optimize accuracy and performance, and export models in different formats. The models can run on Ascend AI Processors through inference frameworks such as MindIE and vLLM Ascend.

### 👤 To msModelSlim Users

- This tool is intended solely for debugging and development. You are responsible for any risks and should carefully review the following information:
  - msModelSlim depends on third-party open-source software such as Transformers and PyTorch, which is provided and maintained by their respective communities. Resolution of issues in these dependencies relies on community contributions and feedback. Please notice that the msModelSlim repository does not guarantee fixes for issues in third-party software, nor does it guarantee testing or correction of all vulnerabilities or errors in such software.
  - When you use msModelSlim, it reads model weights from local storage based on provided command-line parameters or configuration files. Using untrusted model weights may cause unknown security risks. You are advised to use methods such as SHA256 verification to ensure model weights are trusted before passing them to the tool.
  - To ensure security and implement the principle of least privilege, you are advised to use msModelSlim as a standard user rather than a high-privilege user (such as root).
    - Adhere to the principle of least privilege. For example, prevent other users from writing data by disabling permissions such as `666` and `777`.
    - Ensure the `umask` value of the execution user is greater than or equal to `0027` to prevent excessive permissions on generated quantized model directories and files.
      - To check the `umask` value, run the `umask` command.
      - To change the `umask` value, run the `umask new_value` command.
    - Ensure that original model data and quantized model data are stored in the current user directory without symbolic links to avoid potential security issues.
  - Data processing and deletion: Users are responsible for managing and deleting any data generated while using this tool. You are advised to promptly delete any related data after use to prevent information leaks.
  - Data confidentiality and transmission: Users understand and agree not to share or transmit any data generated by this tool. Neither the tool nor its developers are responsible for any information leaks, data breaches, or other negative consequences.
  - User input security: Users are responsible for the security of any commands they enter and for any risks or losses resulting from improper input. The tool and its developers are not liable for issues caused by incorrect command usage.
- Disclaimer scope: This disclaimer applies to all individuals and entities using this tool. By using the tool, you acknowledge and accept this statement and assume all risks and responsibilities arising from its use. If you do not agree, please stop using the tool immediately.
- Before using this tool, please read and understand the preceding disclaimer. If you have any questions, contact the developer.

### 📦 To Data Owners
